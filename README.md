# Tarot-Door
This program is similar to my previous egg puzzle, put four objects in place to trigger four reed switches, and deactivate a magnetic lock.
In this case, one of the cards/reed switches we had in place stopped working, so I removed it from the sequence and we just stuck down that card as a "put these here when you find them" clue
